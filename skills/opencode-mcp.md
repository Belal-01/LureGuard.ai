# opencode — MCP behavior (mandatory)

You run inside **opencode** with the **LureGuard MCP server** (`lureguard`). Follow these rules in every session.

## Golden rule

**Use MCP tools. Do not reimplement them in the shell or in Python.**

| Task | Correct action | Wrong action |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| Onboard a VM | `onboard_host_tool` | `python -c`, `docker exec`, `ssh`, edit `server.py` |
| List fleet | `list_agents` | `curl` Wazuh API |
| Triage | `get_recent_alerts` | Query Postgres directly |

## Never offer workarounds

Do **not** present choices like:
- "Fix the code + restart MCP **or** run the script directly"
- "The tool is broken so I'll bypass it"
- "I'll re-apply the async fix in server.py"

There is **one** path: call the MCP tool. If it fails, diagnose using the table below — then ask the **human** to take the single remediation step. You do not edit LureGuard code during onboard workflows (see `skills/onboard-host.md`).

**Symptom:** `onboard_host_tool` returns  
`SSH password required. Set ONBOARD_SSH_PASSWORD in .env or pass ssh_password.`

**Cause:** MCP server was started before `.env` was updated, or opencode needs a restart to reload MCP after config changes. The MCP server **loads `.env` from the repo root on startup** (`lureguard_mcp/config.py`).

**Your response:**
1. If user says `.env` already has `ONBOARD_SSH_PASSWORD`: ask them to **restart opencode** (Ctrl+C, then `opencode`), then call `onboard_host_tool` with empty `ssh_password`.
2. If user gives you the password in chat: pass `ssh_password` to the tool — never repeat it in findings.
3. Do **not** offer shell/python bypasses.

## Stale MCP process (common)

**Symptom:** `onboard_host_tool` returns  
`asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop`

**Cause:** opencode started before the latest MCP code was loaded. The fix (`async def onboard_host_tool` + async-safe `@audited` wrapper) is **already in the repo**.

**Your response (exact playbook):**
1. Tell the user: *"The MCP server is running old code. Please quit opencode completely (Ctrl+C) and run `opencode` again, then ask me to continue onboarding."*
2. **Stop.** Do not edit files. Do not run Python. Do not call docker.
3. After the user confirms restart, call `onboard_host_tool` again for the same IP.

## Other MCP / tool failures

| Error hint | You do | You do not |
|------------|--------|------------|
| SSH / connection | Quote tool JSON `error`; ask user to verify IP/credentials | Retry with raw `ssh` |
| Wazuh API / auth | Ask user to run `make doctor` | Start authd, edit Wazuh config, `curl` API |
| `success: false` | Report verbatim; `close_investigation` | Invent fix; alternate enrollment method |
| Tool missing | Ask user to run `make doctor` and restart opencode | Patch MCP server mid-session |

## Onboard mode

When user says onboard / protect / enroll: load `skills/onboard-host.md` and follow it exactly.

## Reports, charts, and PDF

- **`save_report`** auto-adds a `## Visual summary` section with **PNG images** (matplotlib) when DB data exists — no user opt-in required.
- Charts are **images only**: `![title](reports/assets/.../chart.png)` — never HTML/SVG chart widgets in markdown.
- **Extra charts:** `generate_report_chart` (custom labels/values JSON) or `generate_report_chart_preset` (`events_by_channel`, `alert_level_distribution`, `cve_by_severity`, `investigation_timeline`) before save.
- **PDF:** bundled via `make venv` (**WeasyPrint** + `markdown`) — no pandoc; embeds PNG charts inline.
- **Telegram (always PDF):** `send_report_to_telegram(file_path="reports/....md")` or `save_report(..., send_telegram=true)` — always delivers PDF; pass the `.md` path.
- **Local PDF file (user asks):** `convert_report_to_pdf` or `save_report(..., as_pdf=true)` when the user wants a PDF saved to disk.
